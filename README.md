**Liver Disease Prediction**

This project aims to predict liver disease using patient data. Through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and model-building, we identify significant patterns and develop an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model as the most accurate classifier. The project also includes a Streamlit web application for easy access and interaction with the model.

**#Project Overview**

Liver disease is a significant health concern globally. This project uses a dataset to predict liver disease and provides insights through data analysis and modeling.

**#Repository Structure**

-> LiverDisease_EDA.ipynb: This notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where we clean, preprocess, and explore the dataset to uncover patterns.

-> Model Building.ipynb: This notebook focuses on model building. We test multiple algorithms and select the SVM model, which achieves a test accuracy of 94%.

-> app.py: The Streamlit application for deploying the model. This provides an interactive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.

**#Features**

1.Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization of distributions, correlations, and trends in liver disease data.

3.Model Selection: Implementation of various machine learning models with SVM as the optimal choice based on accuracy.

4.Deployment: A Streamlit web app for user-friendly access to the prediction model.

**#Requirements**

To run the notebooks and app locally, install the following libraries:  pip install -r requirements.txt
